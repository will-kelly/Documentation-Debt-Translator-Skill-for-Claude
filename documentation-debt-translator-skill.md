# Documentation debt translator

## Overview

Translates technical content operations problems into CFO-legible business risk statements with quantified financial impacts and timeline projections. Serves as an elevator pitch generator for content operations ROI conversations.

## Purpose

Enterprise technical documentation problems speak in practitioner language: "outdated runbooks," "tribal knowledge," "tool sprawl." CFOs need executive language: "operational risk," "revenue exposure," "competitive disadvantage." This skill bridges that gap, converting technical debt signals into business impact statements that unlock budget conversations.

## When to use this skill

**Primary triggers:**
- Technical content problems that need executive buy-in
- Documentation debt audits requiring business case development
- Content operations maturity gaps that block strategic initiatives
- Budget requests for documentation improvement programs
- Risk assessment conversations about knowledge management

**Ideal for:**
- Fractional consultants translating client pain into proposals
- Content ops leaders building internal business cases
- Technical writers advocating for documentation investment
- Enterprise architects quantifying information architecture risk

## Core translation framework

### Input categories

The skill processes four primary types of technical debt:

1. **Outdated documentation**
   - Runbooks pointing to deprecated systems
   - API documentation trailing actual implementations
   - Process docs divorced from current workflows
   - Security procedures referencing retired tools

2. **Tribal knowledge concentration**
   - Single points of failure in knowledge retention
   - Undocumented system dependencies
   - Expert-dependent operational procedures
   - Implicit institutional knowledge

3. **Tool sprawl and fragmentation**
   - Content scattered across multiple platforms
   - Redundant documentation systems
   - Inconsistent information architecture
   - Platform migration debt

4. **Content operations dysfunction**
   - No ownership model for documentation
   - Reactive-only maintenance cycles
   - Missing review/approval workflows
   - Absent success metrics

### Output structure

Each translation produces:

**Quantified business impact**
- Direct cost calculations (labor hours, incident response, rework)
- Revenue exposure estimates (customer churn risk, deal friction)
- Risk multipliers (regulatory, security, competitive)
- Opportunity costs (innovation blocked, market response delayed)

**Timeline projection**
- Current state snapshot
- Degradation trajectory without intervention
- Critical threshold dates
- Compounding risk factors

**Executive narrative**
- One-sentence risk statement
- Three-point business case
- Comparative context (industry benchmarks, competitor gaps)
- Decision urgency framing

- Compliance audit failure probability
- Security incident likelihood multipliers
- Business continuity gaps from tribal knowledge
- Competitive disadvantage acceleration

### Narrative construction rules

**Language constraints:**
- Zero technical jargon in executive summary
- Industry-standard business metrics only
- Peer comparison framing when possible
- Urgency without alarmism

**Credibility markers:**
- Conservative estimates with ranges
- Explicit assumption documentation
- Industry benchmark citations

**Decision architecture:**
- Clear recommendation with alternatives
- Investment vs. risk tradeoff framing
- Phased approach options
- Quick win identification

## Example translations

### Case 1: Outdated runbooks

**Technical input:**
"Our incident response runbooks reference systems we deprecated 18 months ago. Teams waste 2-3 hours per incident figuring out current procedures through Slack archaeology."

**CFO translation:**
"Outdated operational procedures are costing $180K-270K annually in incident response delays (12 incidents/month × 2.5 hours average × $120/hour loaded cost × 5 responders). This creates 30-45 hour delays in customer-impacting incident resolution, with direct churn risk in our enterprise segment where SLA compliance is contractual. Without remediation, this compounds as system complexity increases—we're tracking 15% year-over-year growth in infrastructure components, suggesting $230K annual cost by end of next fiscal year. Competitive intelligence shows our primary competitor reduced MTTR by 40% following documentation modernization program."

**Timeline projection:**
- Current state: $225K annual incident response waste
- 6 months without action: First enterprise contract SLA violation risk
- 12 months: Estimated $270K annual cost, 2-3 at-risk enterprise accounts
- 18 months: $315K annual cost, documented competitive disadvantage in RFP responses

**One-sentence pitch:**
"We're burning a quarter-million dollars annually on incident response theater because our operational documentation describes systems we no longer run."

### Case 2: Tribal knowledge concentration

**Technical input:**
"Three senior engineers hold undocumented knowledge of our payment processing integration. No written procedures exist for common failure scenarios. Average team tenure is 3.2 years."

**CFO translation:**
"Critical payment infrastructure knowledge exists exclusively in three individuals' heads, creating $2.1M operational continuity risk (average senior engineer replacement cost $140K × 3 × 5x knowledge transfer multiplier). Payment processing downtime costs $8,500/hour in direct revenue loss based on Q3 transaction volumes. Single expert departure would create 6-8 week vulnerability window during knowledge reconstruction. Industry data shows 23% annual turnover in senior technical roles, suggesting 69% probability of at least one departure within 18 months. This represents uninsurable operational risk that would trigger disclosure requirements in any acquisition scenario."

**Timeline projection:**
- Current state: 3-person single point of failure
- First departure event: 6-8 week elevated risk period, $300K-400K knowledge transfer cost
- Second departure within 12 months: Potential system re-architecture requirement ($800K-1.2M)
- Acquisition scenario: Material disclosure requirement, likely deal value impact

**One-sentence pitch:**
"Our payment infrastructure runs on knowledge that walks out the door when any of three people quit, and actuarial tables say that happens in the next 18 months."

### Case 3: Tool sprawl

**Technical input:**
"Documentation scattered across Confluence, Notion, Google Docs, GitHub wikis, and SharePoint. Teams spend 20-30 minutes per day searching for current information. No single source of truth."

**CFO translation:**
"Content fragmentation across five platforms costs $340K annually in productivity loss (45 technical staff × 25 minutes average daily search time × $85/hour loaded cost × 220 work days), with 15-20% of that time resulting in incorrect information retrieval leading to rework. New employee onboarding extends 2-3 weeks beyond industry benchmarks due to information archaeology requirements, adding $95K annual onboarding cost premium. Tool licensing redundancy represents $47K annual waste in overlapping platform costs. Customer-facing documentation inconsistency correlates with 12% higher support ticket volume in product areas with fragmented internal docs."

**Timeline projection:**
- Current state: $480K total annual cost (productivity + onboarding + licensing + support)
- 12 months without action: $530K (growing team size, increasing content volume)
- 24 months: $590K, plus technical debt from competing platform migrations
- Strategic risk: Content operations dysfunction blocks launch of planned developer portal

**One-sentence pitch:**
"We're spending half a million dollars a year because nobody knows where anything is, and it's getting worse as we hire."

## Integration with existing frameworks

### Content operations maturity scorecard connection

This skill translates maturity scores into business language:

- **Maturity level 1-2:** "Ad hoc content operations creating measurable operational risk"

## Usage examples for skill invocation

### Example 1: Quick assessment translation

**User input:**
```
Technical debt input: API documentation is 6-9 months behind actual implementation. Partner developers report 40% of code examples don't work. We've had 3 partner escalations to executive level in the last quarter.

Organizational context: Series B SaaS company, 280 employees, platform business model with 45 technology partners contributing 30% of customer acquisition.

Audience: CFO during Q1 budget planning
```

**Expected skill output:**
Generates CFO-ready business case showing partner ecosystem revenue risk ($2.8M annual exposure based on 30% acquisition contribution and escalation pattern), developer community trust erosion timeline, competitive disadvantage in partner recruitment, and remediation ROI with 4-6 month payback period.

### Example 2: Board risk reporting

**User input:**
```
Full debt audit translation:
- Technical problems: Tribal knowledge in payment processing (3 person SPOF), outdated runbooks (18 months stale), tool sprawl across 5 platforms, no documentation ownership model
- Current metrics: 45 engineering staff, 12 incidents/month average, 3.2 year average tenure, $180K senior engineer replacement cost
- Business context: Preparing for Series C fundraising in 6 months, high-growth SaaS, competitive market with 4 major rivals
- Budget range: $200K-400K available for documentation program
```

**Expected skill output:**
Comprehensive board memo format showing composite operational risk ($3.2M total annual impact), fundraising technical due diligence vulnerability, competitive positioning gaps with quantified market share implications, phased remediation approach with quick wins in 30-day window, and ROI justification for $350K investment with 8-month payback.

### Example 3: Express elevator pitch

**User input:**
```
Express translation:
Problem: No documentation ownership model—content gets created but never maintained. Everything goes stale within 6 months.
Audience: CIO in hallway conversation
Time constraint: 30-second pitch
```

**Expected skill output:**
"We're in a documentation death spiral: teams create content but nobody owns maintenance, so everything's obsolete in six months. That costs us $225K annually in incident response alone, and it's blocking the customer self-service portal that's supposed to cut support costs by 30%. The fix is a $120K documentation program manager role that pays for itself in 7 months just from incident reduction, before we count the portal ROI."
